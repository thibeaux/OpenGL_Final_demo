# OpenGL Final Project Demo, A 3D Living Room

### How do I approach designing software?

I approached designing the software based off of the sample code provided in each lesson. Its more procedural than object oriented so everything is inside of the main.cpp file. I made functions for each necessary component to generate my 3d scene. This may include my vertex shaders, fragment shaders, main function, render fucnstion, make mesh function, compile shaders, and so on. I also made structs for the mesh objects which contained the vertex arrays and vertex buffers and corresponding index count. This made it easier to generate multiple ojects in the scene. 

### How do I approach developing programs?

My main strategy was to take the example code, analyze what is going on and how it works and then tailored that sample code to my work. Each week we learned something new and I would take the new code of that week and decided which blocks of sample code would work for my scene and what wouldn't. Then I would make it fit to my project. I also would, at the end of each week before the due date, go back and annotate my code and correct variable names to match the rest of the code. 

### How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?

This has really helped my understanding of how code can be used to interact with hardware, the more I develop with OpenGL the more sense it makes to me. I think I can see myself having to use this in the future. From my understandoing simulation programs are widely used in lots of industries.
